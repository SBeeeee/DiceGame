Dice Game
Overview
This is a simple interactive dice game built using React.js. The game lets the user roll a dice and accumulate points based on their dice roll and a selected value. The user can also reset the game or view the rules.
Features:
->Roll the Dice: The user can click on a dice image to roll it, and a random number between 1 and 6 will appear.
->Game Logic: If the rolled dice matches the selected value, the user's total score increases by that value; otherwise, the score decreases by 2.
->Reset Game: The game can be reset, setting all values (total score, dice value, and selected value) back to the default.
->Responsive Design: The game is styled to center the elements and provide a clean interface for the user.
